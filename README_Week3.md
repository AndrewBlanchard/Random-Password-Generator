# Andrew Blanchard Week 3 Challenge

Modified existing Javascript starter code to allow a user to push a button and  create a randomly generated password using different criteria. 

## Usage
Users are prompted on whether what types of characters they want in their password  (Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters)as well as how long they would like their password to be. (Between 8 - 128 characters)
